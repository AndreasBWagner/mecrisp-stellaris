asciiart.4th	ASCII art words

delay.4th	Words for using the systick timer in polling mode

fault.4th	Redefines the fault ISR.  This allows unhandled exceptions
		to report the exception number

swflow.4th	Words for implementing XON/XOFF flow control

gpio.4th	Define constants for GPIO

hwflow.4th	Words for implementing RTS/CTS flow control

init.4th	My sample init routine for automatically running words after
		reset

led.4th		Examples of using the on-board LED
		REQUIRES:  gpio.4th, delay.4th, timer.4th

loopback.4th	Miscellanous words used when testing flowcontrol and uart

m4-core.4th	Memory mapping of Cortex-M4 system control space

mcg.4th		Words to control the Multipurpose Clock Generator (MCG)
		After loading execute "fullspeed" to switch to 96MHz

misc.4th	Holding place for uncategorized words

nvic.4th	Words for enabling/disabling IRQ's.  Also word for creating
		a software triggered interrupt.

struct.4th	Words for creating data structures

terminal.4th	Work-in-progress.  Start of ANSI terminal code words

timer.4th	Words for using the systick timer in interrupt mode
		See led.4th for example of how to use (led-pulse)

uart.4th: 	Words for capturing UART errors and displaying info

usb.4th:  	Work-in-porogress.  Beginning of USB support.
	   	       Unusable at the moment.


Files for facilitating loading the Forth system:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
geninit		This shell script generates a file called "s0init.4th"
		from a selection of other files and inline commands.
		This version should be used if hardware flow control
		is being implemented (or at least the RTS part), or
		you want to permanently run with end-of-line delays.
		
geninit-2stage	This shell script generates a file called "s0init.4th" 
		and "s1init.4th".  s0init.4th is the bare minimum to 
		crank up the clock speed and implement SW flowcontrol.
		For S0 to load, you probably need a 50ms pause at the end
		of newlines.  After S0, you can turn on software flow control
		and should be able to load the S1 file at full speed.
		Note: I have had mxied sucess with SW flow control and
		the PL2303 USB-to-serial chip, so I've switched to HW
		flow control.

ss		A Super Sed script, used by geninit, to strip comments and
		extra white space to minimize file size for uploading.
		If you don't have supersed, remove from geninit and just "cat"
		the files.

s0init.4th	Stage 0 initialization file created by geninit 

s1init.4th	Stage 1 initialization file created by geninit
